Show off hardware wallet

From a fresh store, connect an existing wallet
We're going to select connect hardware wallet
Your computer will look for BTCPay's Vault application
If you do not have it downloaded follow the link to the releases page and download it
Run the exe and accept the notice in the vault app
Now next time you try to connect it will detect your hardware wallet
In this example I'll be using a Jade wallet
Select your wallet type and continue. 
If your jade's firmware is out of date it will ask you to update before continuing
