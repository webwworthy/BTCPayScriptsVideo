00:00 Welcome back to BTCPay Server
00:02 Today we're going to use Vault
00:04 The simplest way to import your hardware wallet and spend from it
00:07 First I'm going to have my Jade wallet plugged in and create a new store
00:11 After you gave it a name hit create
00:14 And then set up a wallet
00:16 And connect an existing wallet
00:18 if you click connect hardware wallet this is going to check if Vault is running
00:21 if you do not have vault, follow the github link and download it
00:25 for mac choose dmg and windows choose dot exe
00:28 run the application and accept the permissions
00:32 now go back to BTCPay server and its fetched the device
00:36 Once its recognized choose your address type and hit confirm
00:40 Now its going to fetch the Xpub, hit continue and confirm these are the correct addresses
00:46 Click save WALLET* settings and your new hardware wallet is all set up with BTCPay server
00:51 and now we're going to spend from it
00:53 click bitcoin in the left and choose send in the top right
00:56 then put in your desitnation address, amount, and set your fee rate
01:02 when your ready hit sign transactration then choose hardware wallet
01:08 make sure your hardware wallet is plugged in and vault is running in the background
01:11 now you should see your transaction to sign on your hardware device
