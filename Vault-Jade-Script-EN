Welcome to BTCPay, today we're going to talk about the Jade hardware wallet and BTCPay's Vault application
In this video I'll show you how easy it is to to set up a hardware wallet and spend from it 

First create a new store, give it a name and hit create
Next set up a wallet and select connect an existing wallet
To use BTCPay with Vault, we're going to choose connect hardware wallet
First it will check if Vault is running
If you do not have it downloaded follow the link to the releases page and download it
Unzip the application and run it by clicking the exe
Plug in your hardware signing device, in my example its a Blockstream Jade
If this is the first time using a hardware device and vault, make sure your accept the notice in vault
Now next time you try to connect it will detect that hardware device
If your jade's firmware is out of date it will ask you to update before continuing

You'll notice BTCPay should be scanning when detected return the devices Xpub and addresses 
Select your address type and click continue
Next you should see an Xpub and the recieving addresses listed
Click confirm and your jade wallet is all set up with BTCPay 

Next we're going to sign a transaction using Vault
Choose Send in the top right
Then input your destination address and set your fee rate
When your ready click sign transaction and then Choose Hardware Wallet
you'll notice it says sign using our Vault Application so make sure that is running 
It can take a second, check your Jade or signing device for the transaction notice
Follow the step its asking then return to BTCPay and finally broadcast transaction
You will be returned to the your wallet page with a notice with your transaction ID
Here you can add labels to your spending and check its status in the mempool by clicking the transaction id
