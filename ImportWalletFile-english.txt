00:00 Welcome to another BTCPay instructional video.

00:03 In this video I'm going to add a new wallet I've previously created on electrum.

00:08 From the dashboard, click "Set up a Wallet"

00:10 Then Choose "Connect an existing wallet". 

00:13 There are many methods to possibly use, for our example we are going to select "Import Wallet File"

00:19 Next im going to open up electrum and save a back up of my wallet file. 

00:24 Click on file then "save backup"

00:27 Remember where you have saved this for the next step.

00:30 Now go back to BTCPay where we left off. 

00:33 Click choose file, navigate to where you saved that wallet file and then click continue

00:38 To confirm this is the correct wallet file check the addresses listed against your addresses shown in electrum.

00:44 These should be the same addresses shown in electrum and BTCPay if you have selected the correct wallet file.

00:51 After you have checked that finally click confirm. 

00:55 Now your new wallet file is connected to this BTCPay store. 

00:59 There are some more advanced settings if you'd change your confirmation requirements or invoice expiration time.

01:06 The most important thing to keep in mind is each store you create can have its own wallet and lightning node.

01:12 When your happy with the settings click save payment settings. 

01:16 One final thing to mention is if you want to remove this wallet go back to the dashboard

01:21 then click bitcoin under the wallets pannel on the left

01:24 Now click the gear icon in the top right

01:27 you should see a drop down menu called "actions" 

01:30 Select remove wallet, then a pop up window will ask you to confirm this action.

01:35 Type "remove" and note this is case sensitive. 

01:39 Thank you for watching another BTCPay instuctional video
